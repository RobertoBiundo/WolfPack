The following considerations were made
- A wolf can be in many packs and a pack can therefore be in many groups.
This is done since the spirit of the project is to organize the employees in teams. It is therefore imagined that an employee can be in many teams. In a real case the customer would be consulted beforehand.
- Names and LastNames can be expressed with UTF-8 characters. Could not be the case for employees of other cultures (example Japan)
- A limit of time was kept to 4h based on the original conversation with the WolfPack team and a basic architecture was created based on the timeframe and requirements. Job Started at 7.45 and ended at 11.20
- No bulk operations were provided on the API since the assumption of 35-100 employees seems manageable without them. This would also be consulted with the client beforehand.


Recommendations
- Include authentication using Identity
- Improve validation error messages to simplify the default ones from Fluent Validation
- Improvements to the architecture could be made to separate the data layers and service layers better using a Data Store pattern.

Notes: 
- Find in the project an export of Postman in json format that can be imported for V2.1+ format supported Postmans
